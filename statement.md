PROBLEM STATEMENT: PALINDROME CHECKER

OBJECTIVE

Develop a software tool that accepts a string input from a user and
determines whether that string is a palindrome.

DEFINITION

A "palindrome" is a sequence of characters which reads the same backward
as forward, such as "madam" or "racecar".

REQUIREMENTS

Input:
The program must prompt the user to enter a word via the console.

Logic:
The program must compare characters from the beginning of the string
with characters from the end of the string, moving inwards.

Output:

If the string matches its reverse, print:
"{word} is a Palindrome Checker Tool"

If the string does not match, print:
"{word} is not a Palindrome Checker Tool"

Constraints:
The comparison should be case-insensitive (e.g., 'A' matches 'a').
